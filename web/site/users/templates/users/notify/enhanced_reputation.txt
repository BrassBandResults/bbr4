Hello,

As you've added many results on
http://brassbandresults.co.uk/, we've added a little extra
functionality for you.

You should now be able to:
- Delete results you entered
- Add new bands and edit bands you created
- Add new conductors and edit conductors you created
- Add new test pieces and edit test pieces you created
- All sorts of other little bits around the site

Any problems, let us know.

Enjoy!

Tim & Sharon
